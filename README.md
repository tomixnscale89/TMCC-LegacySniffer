# TMCC-LegacySniffer
 Listen to commands sent through Lionel SER2 or BASE

How to use:

1. Open sniffer
2. Type in number of com port you want to listen to. Use device manager to figure out the one you need.
3. If you made a mistake, you have unlimited chances. 

The Hex and binary of the command is sent through. Sometimes commands are not sent cleanly, so you'll need to try a couple times.
